Subject: API Passphrase Verification for Gmail Signal Integration

Hi Mathematricks Team,

I'm setting up the Gmail Signal Integration system for vandan@mathematricks.fund and need to verify the API passphrase.

Current Configuration:
- Strategy Name: Gmail_Signal_Integration
- API Endpoint: https://mathematricks.fund/api/signals
- Email Account: gagan@getfoolish.com (monitoring for signals)

Current Passphrase (being rejected):
bob_trading_signals_24sddty2g

Error Received:
HTTP 401 - {"error":"Unauthorized: Invalid passphrase"}

Questions:
1. Is this the correct passphrase for our account?
2. Should the strategy name be different?
3. Are there any special characters or case-sensitivity requirements?
4. Is there a different passphrase for vandan@mathematricks.fund?

Technical Details:
- System is fully configured and ready
- Gmail push notifications working
- Only waiting on correct API passphrase to go live

Please provide the correct passphrase so we can complete the integration.

Thank you!
